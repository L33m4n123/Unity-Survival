**Unity Survival**
 
A small simple test survival game in Unity. 
Just doing it for fun :3 
 
So. What do I want to do next?

As I want some sort of Base Building involved I might use some Voxel Based Optic. Minecraft-esque. 
Will be for me the easiest as I can't design levels and will be quite easy for building actually

Basics
* Basic Movement - commit [2d7530a](https://github.com/L33m4n123/Unity-Survival/commit/2d7530ab8f1c28f0b44ccb352d72701305ab4566)
* Sprinting
* Stamina
* Crouching
* Day Night Cycle
* Random Generated World
* Destroying and Placing blocks
* Save & Load

Later down the road
* Hunger System (including ways to get food)
* passive & agressive mobs
* Inventory System
* Crafting

After the above mentioned
* Maybe look into CoOp Features
